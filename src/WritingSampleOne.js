// Project: Writing Jest tests for the JavaScript in our Revenue Counter.

// Over the past few weeks, I successfully learned the testing framework Jest and wrote a few tests for our Revenue Counter. While doing this, I found I needed to rewrite some of that JavaScript code in order for the tests to be efficient and effective. It was an awesome process. I learned a lot about testing and a lot about JavaScript. Now we have a few tests in place for the Revenue counter! I'll be writing more tests as time goes now, especially now that it's set up.

// Testing code in a project can sometimes get overlooked. There are several reasons for this.

//     Learning a testing framework takes time.
//     Writing tests takes time
//     In order to write a proper test, sometimes the code needs to be rewritten/reworked
//     When you write new code or edit existing code you will need to review existing tests to make sure they are accurate and will pass


// We haven't really implemented any frontend tests. So it’s definitely an opportunity.

// While this process takes a lot of time up front, it will save time in the future. One of the things that testing helps with is by providing a proactive alert if code is not functioning as expected. This can be incredibly helpful in allowing us to be proactive in fixing a potential problem. Without tests, certain functionality may not be working as expected and we would not know until someone saw the issue. That someone could be an internal employee perusing the site or, worse case, it could be a user trying to use the site only to find a certain functionality is not working as expected. Writing tests will proactively alert us of potential errors before a user does. This process helps provide a fluid experience for a user and will increase their delightful experience, their likelihood of returning to buy more products and their likelihood of spreading the good news about this awesome product and it’s easy-to-use website.  

// The proposed solution here is to learn a testing framework. In this case, I decided to become familiar with three different frameworks in order to choose the best one for our needs. The expected result is that we will have a safety netting underneath our code which helps us be proactive in addressing any potential change in functionality. Now that I've written a few tests, we have started to build that safety net and I've also now set the foundation to make writing future tests easier. 

// I still plan on investigating 2 other frameworks to see if they will be more helpful.
